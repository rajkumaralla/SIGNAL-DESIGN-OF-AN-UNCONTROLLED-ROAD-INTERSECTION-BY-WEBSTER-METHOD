# SIGNAL-DESIGN-OF-AN-UNCONTROLLED-ROAD-INTERSECTION-BY-WEBSTER-METHOD
A traffic signal is used as an instructing device that indicates the road user to act according to the 
displayed sign. Signal designing is a technique which is generally adopted by the traffic engineers 
use to determine who has the right-of-way at an intersection which involves deciding how much 
green time the traffic lights shall provide at an intersection approach, how long the pedestrian walk 
signal should be, and many numerous other factors. The design of traffic signal nowadays has 
become an important factor for major intersections of towns and cities. Traffic signal controls the 
movement of traffic and not only reduces accidents but enables the road safety users to effectively 
use the area of road at intersection. An uncontrolled 3 road intersection (Kothavalasa Junction) is 
considered and signal designing is carried out using Webster method of Signal design.
